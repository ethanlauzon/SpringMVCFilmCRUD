## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project

## Description
This project grants us access to the table in the database titled film. Using this program you can search by ID or keyword to find film/films that match the given ID or keyword. When the user is matched with a film they are able to see the film's title, description, actors, language, category and ID. The user is also able to edit any of the film's properties and whatever they choose to edit will then be updated in the database. The user is also given the choice of creating and new film and then adding their unique film into the database's film table.

## Technologies Used
MySql, Git, Terminal, Html, Spring, Java, JSPs

## Lessons Learned
Working on this project my teammate and I learned how to clearly communicate our issues within the program and how to solve them. This helped us solve issues more quickly and kept us from making more mistakes. This full-stack project taught use to use controllers and implementations to interact with various JSPs and html files. This project also taught us the importance of test driven development as small changes could completely alter the program. Frequent testing allowed us to pin point any issues quickly. Finally, we learned how to fix merge conflicts with pushing/pulling to and from git.
